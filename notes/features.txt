Read/write to existing compendia
    Module will have compendia setup as default
    User settings for GM to determine what the default is. Actor tab or compendia, and which compendium if that is chosen.
    Module will respect the user permissions granted so that if a player is given access to module they will only be able to read/write to compendia they have access to
Changes to NPC update dynamically
Drag and drop from actor from either actor tab or compendium to supply stats to start from
    Have option to start from defaults rather than drag and drop if they want
        user setting to determine what default stats are.
        Maybe have choice between stat generation for random stat generation, 4d6 drop lowest etc 
    Ability to reset all or individual stats to default
Ability to modify feats, features, spells, etc and save modified "homebrewed" actor/feats/spells etc into appropriate compendia
    Use existing create new functionality for these 
Ability to choose which attacks/spells/features are used to calculate the creature's CR 
New attribute to track for actors, CR adjustment
    user will be able to set what they believe the appropriate amount of adjustment to CR a feature is. RAW features will be maintained, adjustments will go to "homebrewed"
    versions of the feature/spell/etc
    Visible only to GM, or based on permissions at least. So players can't estimate CR of creature by adding up the adjustments from eah feature
Short cuts
    Open module
    "quick save" currently edited actor
    Export to Json? 
        not sure that it's needed, if so have user setting to determine where to save the file? Probably default to the module's folder within Foundry's data structure
